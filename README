Dropbox Developer PC Setup
====================================
Setup a new developer PC with all the bangles and widgets you're used to.

This script will obliterate big swaths of your OS (including /etc and ~/
contents) and symlink them from your Dropbox folder. It only works in
this direction because otherwise Dropbox will be clever about the symlinks
and just store files on the service as real files. It is possible to run two
relatively homogeneous machines concurrently off of these profiles.

Dropbox layout:
Dropbox/
  Portable_Configuration/
    etc/
      ...etc dir and file replacements...
    home/
      ...home dir and file replacements...
    machines/
      HOSTNAME_1/
        etc/
          ...machine-specific etc files (hosts, e.g.)...
        home/
          ...machine-specific home files (hosts, e.g.)...
    manual/
      ssh_config
